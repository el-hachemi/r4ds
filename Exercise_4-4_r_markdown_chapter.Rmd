The question is about caching:  

> Set up a network of chunks where d depends on c and b, and both b and c depend on a. Have each chunk print `lubridate::now()`, set `cache = TRUE`, then verify your understanding of caching.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
```

```{r a, cache=TRUE}
x <- 2
now()
```

```{r b, cache=TRUE, dependson="a"}
y <- x + 2
now()
```

```{r c, cache=TRUE, dependson="a"}
z <- x / 2
now()
```

```{r d, cache=TRUE, dependson=c("c","b")}
p <- y + z / 2
now()
```
